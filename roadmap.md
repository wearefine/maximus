# Roadmap

* Check for a maximus.yml config file (for base_url, config_url, etc.) and load config globally when starting, or something similar - calling is_dev happens too often
* Check for custom lint or stat hooks in a lib/maximus folder
* Use PhantomJS 2.0 with webfont support
* Resolve/review TODOs
* Tests and specs
* Convert ruby-git to rugged (MAYBE - rugged requires libgit2)
* Add SCSS specificity graph
* Add HAML lint (maybe)
* Add CSS lint (maybe)
* Add JSLint (maybe)
* Add W3 validator (maybe)
* Regex path names on phantomas and wraith to defend against injection and bad characters
