# Roadmap

* Check for custom lint or stat hooks in a lib/maximus folder. Add custom lint path and script execution support to maximus.yml config file
* Use PhantomJS 2.0 with webfont support
* Resolve/review @todos
* Convert ruby-git to rugged (MAYBE - rugged requires libgit2)
* Add SCSS specificity graph
* Add HAML lint (maybe)
* Add CSS lint (maybe)
* Add JSLint (maybe)
* Add W3 validator (maybe)
* Regex path names on phantomas and wraith to defend against injection and bad characters
* Test for < ruby 2.0 or require 2.0 < in gemspec
